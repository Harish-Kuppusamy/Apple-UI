            Card eligibility is subject to terms and conditions between you and

            trade-in credit or eligible discount is applied. Any subsequent

            cashback being recalculated, and any refund may be adjusted to
            account for instant cashback clawback; this may result in no refund
            being made to you. Offer may be revised or withdrawn at any time
            without any prior notice. Additional terms apply. Instant cashback
